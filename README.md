# amazee.io Lagoon - where the cool microservices hang out!

The amazee.io lagoon is the amazee.io deployment system, completely independent from any servers running. Perfect for local development, testing new features and taking over the world.

2. init everything
		./init.sh
3. run docker things
		docker-compose up
4. run tests (best in another terminal)
		./runtest.sh
